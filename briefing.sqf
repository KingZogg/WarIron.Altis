"Hints and Tips",
"
<br/><font size='18'>A3Wasteland</font>
<br/>
<br/>* At the start of the game, spread out and find supplies before worrying about where to establish a meeting place or a base, supplies are important and very valuable.
<br/>
<br/>* When picking a base location, it is best advised to pick a place that is out of the way and not so obvious such as airports, cities, map-bound bases, etc. remember, players randomly spawn in and around towns and could even spawn inside your base should you set it up in a town.
<br/>
<br/>* If you spawn in an area with no vehicles or supplies in the immediate area, DO NOT just click respawn from the pause menu, chances are if you search an area of a few hundred meters, you will find something.
<br/>
<br/>* When you set up a base, never leave your supplies unguarded, one guard will suffice, but it is recommended you have at least 2, maybe 3 guards at base at all times.
<br/>
<br/>* There are very aggressive AI characters that spawn with most missions and will protect the mission objectives with deadly force, be aware of them.

"About Wasteland",
"
<br/>Wasteland is a team versus team versus team sandbox survival experience. The objective of this mission is to rally your faction, scavenge supplies, weapons, and vehicles, and destroy the other factions. It is survival at its best! Keep in mind this is a work in progress, please direct your reports to http://forums.a3wasteland.com/
<br/>
<br/>FAQ:
<br/>
<br/>Q. What am I supposed to do here?
<br/>A. See the above description
<br/>
<br/>Q. Where can I get a gun?
<br/>A. Weapons are found in one of two places, first in ammo crates that come as rewards from missions, and second, in the gear section of the vehicles, which also randomly spawn around the map. The last place to find a gun would be at the gunshops located throughout the map. You can also find them on dead players and AI whose bodies have not yet been looted.
<br/>
<br/>Q. What are the blue circles on the map?
<br/>A. The circles represent town limits. If friendly soldiers are in a town, you can spawn there from the re-spawn menu; however if there is an enemy presence, you will not be able to spawn there.
<br/>
<br/>Q. Is it ok for me to shoot my team mates?
<br/>A. If you are member of BLUFOR or OPFOR teams, then you are NOT allowed to shoot or steal items and vehicles from other players. If you play as Independent, you are free to engage anyone as well as team up with anyone you want.
<br/>
<br/>Q. Whats with the canisters, baskets and big bags?
<br/>A. This game has a food and water system that you must stay on top of if you hope to survive. You can collect food and water from food sacks and wells, or baskets and plastic canisters dropped by dead players. Food and water will also randomly spawn around the map.
<br/>
<br/>Only vehicles have guns and other loot. Buildings have none.

<br/>The Gold Sub Mission is a sub that has been damaged and is in a minefield. 
<br/>The Sub Mission times out after 2 Hours. Gold and the sub will stay if the divers are killed.
<br/>It can be repaired and refuelled. 
<br/>
<br/>The Sub and the divers guarding it, could be anywhere in the red mine field area marked on the map. 
<br/>The divers are usually at the surface. They dive if attacked.
<br/>
<br/>The sub and the divers are NOT at the same place ... (usually).
<br/>
<br/>Once all the divers are killed, the gold is in tin boxes that are found under and around the sub. (The boxes can be very hard to see.)
<br/>Use your mouse wheel to pick one up when you are over one.
<br/>
<br/>A player can only carry 10 tins of gold at any one time.
<br/>
<br/>You can load some of the gold tins into the sub and move it, if you have refuelled and repaired it.
<br/>
<br/>You can't load the gold into land vehicles.
<br/>
<br/>Gold can only be sold to a Gold buyer at the gold buyer shop.
<br/>
<br/>Summary.
<br/>Step 1. Find the divers at the surface. (usually)
<br/>Step 2. Find the sub at the bottom and take the gold that spawns under it once the divers are dead.
<br/>Step 3. (Optional) Fix and refuel the sub. It can hold 10 Boxes of gold.

<br/>The server is has only this mission running on it for full optimisation.
<br/>
<br/>Teamspeak is ts3.wariron.com. If you need an admin wait in the waiting for admin channel. 
<br/>Feel free to poke admins.
<br/>
<br/>The game play is designed to be brutal and very hard.
<br/>Hard work does have it's rewards.
<br/>
<br/>The database is external.
<br/>The headless client is running.
<br/>
<br/>Lot's of missions running at the same time are not much fun so there is only one type of mission running at a time.
<br/>
<br/>Everyone starts off equally. There are no sniper medic or engineer slots.
<br/>If you want to play as a diver etc please go and buy the gear.
<br/>
<br/>Thermal Vehicle weapons are enabled.
<br/>
<br/>The beacon detector needs a mine detector to work and the range is limited.
<br/>
<br/>TeamKill Autokick is in place. 
<br/>The Tk's are not reset after a restart so anyone who keeps doing it will be autobanned.
<br/>
<br/>Repack your magazines with CTRL-R (can be changed when you open it). 
<br/>
<br/>Use the earplugs to hear when you are in a vehicle and on teamspeak. Use the END key (Can't be changed). 
<br/>
<br/>View distance settings can be finely adjusted depending on which mode you are in. 
<br/>ie: Walking, Driving or Flying.
<br/>
<br/>We hate fog and it will never be in the game. Rain is also off (it might come back).
<br/>
<br/>A player can only carry 10 tins of gold at any one time.
<br/>You can load the gold tins into the sub and move it, if you have refuelled and repaired it.
<br/>You can't load the gold into any other vehicle.
<br/>
<br/>Vehicles are locked and untowable or liftable after a restart. Only the owner can unlock them.
<br/>
<br/>You can break into vehicles using a Toolkit. It has a random chance of failing.
<br/>
<br/>Vehicle actions are pretty self explanatory see in game for what you can do.
<br/>Lock, UnLock, Unflip, or Pull a driver from a vehicle.
<br/>
<br/>Baseparts take a LONG time to unlock if you are not the owner.
<br/>
<br/>This is a new server so any suggestions on improvements are welcome.
<br/>
<br/>New secret spiced up missions are always in development.
